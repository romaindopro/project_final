# project_final
This my project for "iletaitunefeuille.com"
I used Symfony 6 and DBMaria for the backend part.
For the front part i used JSVanilla, Twig, Html and CSS.

My goal it's make this website reponsive with no bug. Protect my form from any injections. 
I made a XML/AJAX call for any articles on my blog.
I hope you going to have a great experience and you can make me some comments because i think i can inproved much more.
Thank you.
